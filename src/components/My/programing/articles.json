It is a mutable object that persists a value across multiple re-renderings. It is really similar to the useState hook except you read and write its value through its .current property, and changing its value won’t re-render the component.<br/></cite><br/><br/> In<b> setState</b> if this is different component it will have tirggered useEffect with [] or ComponentDidMount. Additionally rerender is of already existing DOM component. <br/><b>const</b> and <b>let</b> can be used for constant values but not random id because it cannot be changed during rerender. Updating let and const values will not trigger rerender so if these values are used inside return code it will not be updated. <br/>In <b>useRef</b> value persist through multiple renders but its changing will not trigger re-render. However it can be accumulated between rerenders. <br/><code> const variable = useRef(5)<br/>setTimeout(()=>{</br/>  variable.current+3; <br/>},100)<br/>return {variable.current}</code>. <br/><cite>If we have mutable values that we want to remember at the next or later renders and we don’t want them to trigger a re-render when they change, then we should use useRef</cite><br/>It can be also used for animatons as it prevents infinite loops in useEffect when animation changes the state what will rerender component what is not desirable in case of animations",

In Chrome there are no selectors for two parts of track. The before and after selectors does not work as they do not work for inputs. However, the parts of input range are visible in Chrome as div elements. I was not able to get to that using sass. The ways to style parts of track in Chrome is <b>linear gradient</b> or using <b>background shadow</b> for one direction on thumb and setting overflow hidden on input in order to shadow to be visible only on track. However styling using boxshadow  does not allow using different values on this property as it will not be visible. Using linear gradient in javascript also required working in original component thus does not allow another styling eg of thumb."

      "content": "'Methods with which to handle component state and trigger effects at points during component's lifecycle now need to be imported if they are required. These works entirely based on the order in which they are called by each component which uses them, as they do not know which component has called them. That's why you can only call hooks at the top level of the component and they can't be called conditionally.<br/>JavaScript is not a class-based language. It is prototype-based. Classes are added in ES6.<br/>Newer setState on this.state, take out the value first.<br/>For class component remember that insie the constructor the binding for functions is added.<br/><code>this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)</code><br/>In the case of class component React creates the instance of the class using <b>new</b>keyword.<br/><code>const instance = new Component(props)</code></br/>In case of functional components starting with function they are also created with <b>new</b> keyword. When a function is called with <b>new</b> it is treated as a constructor function; a new object is created, the <b>this</b> variable is pointed to it and the function is executed with the new object being used whenever <b>this</b> is mentioned'.<br/><b>this</b> inside class component points to instance of this component.<br/>'JavaScript allows inheritance of properties and methods between objects through <b/>prototype chain</b>Unlike in other languages with classes, where properties are copied from a class to its instances, JavaScript objects have an internal prototype link which points to another object. When calling a method or attempting to access a property, JavaScript first checks for it in object itself, if it cannot find it, it checks the object's prototype, then prototype's prototype and so on. Generally all objects in JavaScript have <b>Object</b> at the top of their prototype chain. In this way methods such as <b>toString</b> or <b>hasOwnProperty</b> can be accessed. The chain ends when an object is reached with <b>null</b> as its prototype, this is normally at <b>Object</b>.<br/><b>__proto__</b> is an accessor property to the internal prototype of the object - it containes all properties of parent object used in <code>const child = Object.create(parent, {name: {value: 'child'}})</code>.Every object has __proto__ containing contents of <b>Object</b>.__proto__ is only a reference to a linked object. <br/>If you use a new keyword to call a constructor function then this linking happens automatically to the constructor function's prototype property.<br/>Since React calls our function with the <b>new </b> keyword, to make the methods available in our's component prototype chain we just need to add them to the prototype property of the constructor function, like <code>Countrer.prototype.render = function () {}<br/>Counter.prototype.handleClick = functon () {} <br/></code><b>Static method</b><br/>In class, just need to prefix method with <b>static</b> keyword.<br/>In function <code>function Example () {<br/>Example.staticMethod = function () {}}<br/><code>For both cases it is called Example.staticMethod().<br/><b>Extending React.Component</b><br/>React needs to know if our function is a regular function or contructor function / whether it was created with new keyword.React looks for a property on the component called <b>isReactComponent</b>, which value is an empty object. <br/>We need to link the properties from React.Component.prototype to Counter.prototype.__proto__. This can be done with' <code>Object.setPrototypeOf(Counter.prototype, React.Component.prototype)</code><br/>",

Unlike setState useState does not automatically merge update objects. To get this do <br/><code>setState(prevState => {return {...prevState, ...updatedValues}}</code>Object.assign would also work. Another option is useReducer - more suited for managing state objects.<br/>Lazy initial render - inside function can be passed - then it will be executed only on initial render. it value is calculated outside it will be recalculated every time.<br/><b>2. useEffect </b><br/>The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is commited to the screen. The clean-up functions runs before the component is removed from the UI to prevent memory leaks. Additionally if component is rendered many times the previos effect is cleaned before executing the next effect.Difference with <b>componentDidMount</b> and <b>componentDidUpdate</b> the function passed to useEffect fires AFTER layout and paint, during the deffered event => suitable for common side effect, like setting up subscriptions and event handler, because most types of work should not block the browser from  updating the screen. For DOM mutations (must fire synchronously) use useLayoutEffect. In useEffect array props.data cana be passed. Make sure that the array inlcudes all values from the component scope (such as props and state) that change over time and that are used by effect."

In React for this two attributes no camelCase syntax is used. aria-label takes string as value. With the same values person using speach reacogition would have to specify which one to use. aria-labbeled-by takes id ref as its value. <br/>If there are two links on the page redirecting to the same page they should have the same accesible name.<br/> For the checkboxes the element to group them is <code><b>fieldset</code></b><br/> with <code>legend</code> html element as title of whole fieldset.

What is means that it is lost and in what situation he got it back. 'It's natural for those with sight to be tricked'. Incompleteness - journey and getting the missing parts. 1. Skin: feeling. Lack of feeling takes away compassion - theft. Compassion - he saved kid falling down. 2. Spine: life, strength, pride, morality? - monk, who saw his origin. Lack of spine takes away the limits of actions (proceedings) - deception. Ne did not attack the figure with bell to deceipt. 3. Dentures/learning how to fight - right leg - strength to stand/walk/change his position and overvome his destiny / freedom / protection. Lack of leg / base takes away the possibility of changing ones position / takes away awareness - tortures, murder, taking away of the future. Therefore he wanted to give something - dentures. He fought to protect himself and old man - keeper. Lack of the knowledge of giving - old man: 'I gave you nothing' while he protected him, raised him and gave him knowledge, taught him how to fight. Lack of awareness of possibility of change. 4. He feels no pain therefore he knows no fear. Similarly with 'Zero' in 'Lovelless' manga and anime. Feel, sense - signalizes limits, protects. 'Why the monsters want that? Maybe it fullfills their souls'. 5. Hearing - evil whispers, pleads, advice; vibrations, listening not only by hearing. Lack of hearing - carrying out the wrong command out of fear. Obedience to evil. Listen to someone = give someone power over oneself vs  listening = understand, feel. Lack of hearing - he heard, understood situation.. The taken future cannot be returned. He gave others future. He didn't know how to choose from countless sounds the one he should listen to. 6. Voice - ability to express feelings, state, hope, suffering. Voice as a way of affecting others. He heard the same hopes as his - taking back what was taken away from him. True aim - golden rise fields - happy life together. Hope for achieving the goal. Hope which allows to survive suffering. Acceptance. Beauty - fight for changing the reality. Voice expressing truth vs lies. Laughter - elimination of evil not via annihilation but via change. Bond. Choice. Reaction. Compassion. The same situation. The same feeling of situation - starvation, hunger, life of spider. Trust."
